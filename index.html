 <h1><u>Brief Of AI</u></h1>
 <h3>(AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.<br></br>The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. <br></br>That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. <br></br>But nothing could be further from the truth.Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. <br></br>The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.</h3>
