 <h1>Types of AI</h1>

<h3><p>The AI may be divided into types: Strong AI: The principle at the back of Strong AI is that the machines can be made to suppose or in different words should constitute human minds in the future <br></br>. Thus Strong AI claims that in the near destiny we will be surrounded with the aid of such styles of machines which can absolutely work like humans and machines could have human-level intelligence<br></br>. If that is the case, the ones machines could have the ability to purpose, suppose, and do all features that a human is capable of doing<br>. Current studies is nowhere close to creating strong AI, and a lively debate is ongoing as to whether that is even possible<br></br>. Weak AI: The principle at the back of Weak AI is sincerely the reality that machines can be made to act as if they're wise<br></br>. Weak AI in reality states that thinking like capabilities may be without problems brought to computers to make them more useful gear and this already started to manifest<br>. For example, while a human player plays chess towards a pc, the human player may also sense as though the pc is truly making staggering actions,But the chess application isn't always thinking and planning in any respect.
